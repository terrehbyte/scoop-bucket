# scoop-bucket

This Scoop Bucket contains various tools and programs that I personally use.

To add this bucket to scoop:

```posh
scoop bucket add terrehbyte https://github.com/terrehbyte/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install onetagger
```

You should then be able to install any application by name, such as `onetagger`,
as demonstrated above.
