# scoop-bucket

This is a bucket containing applications that I use.

To easily install applications from this bucket, add this bucket to scoop:

```posh
scoop bucket add terrehbyte https://github.com/terrehbyte/scoop-bucket.git
```

You should then be able to install any application by name, such as `vroidstudio`.
